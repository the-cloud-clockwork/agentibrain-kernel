## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-21

**Brain injection quality + on-demand ticks**: the brain now injects real
synthesized arc summaries backed by a working semantic index instead of
empty-stub scaffolding, and agents can force a tick on demand (`brain_tick` MCP
tool) so freshly-ingested content is retrievable immediately instead of waiting
for the 2h cron. Restores the injected context from near-useless (identical-stub
hot arcs, an index where every arc was equidistant) to a real, queryable memory.
The Compose deployment reaches parity with the Helm one on the same path, and
the update/redeploy procedure is documented for both.

### Features

- **Arc synthesis stage built** (`brain_tick_prompt.py` + `brain_apply.py`) — the
  summary pass was scaffolded but never implemented, so every arc carried an
  empty `synthesized: false` skeleton. The tick now generates a real one-sentence
  summary per arc, written to frontmatter and led into the injected hot-arcs
  table. Drain rate configurable via `BRAIN_MAX_SYNTH_ARCS`; backtick-wrapped
  `SUMMARY:` lines (the model copying the prompt's own format) are parsed, and the
  summary count is reported in the tick log.
- **`brain_tick` MCP tool** (`services/mcp/app/tools/tick.py`) — force a tick on
  demand: enqueues via `POST /tick` and blocks until it lands, so content written
  via `brain_ingest` or as `@lesson`/`@milestone`/`@signal`/`@decision` markers is
  retrievable through `kb_search` / `brain_search_arcs` immediately. `no_ai`
  exposes the sub-5s deterministic path.
- **On-demand tick made retrievable** — the tick-drain CronJob now runs
  `embed_arcs.py` after draining (it previously ran only `brain_tick.py`),
  refreshing the pgvector index so on-demand ticks surface new content. The drain
  also renders the full env map, so a drain-triggered tick uses the same tuning
  (decay/promote thresholds, `EMBEDDINGS_URL`) as the scheduled cron. Cadence
  dropped to every 1 minute.
- **Drain-time request coalescing** — redundant same-kind `POST /tick` requests
  are coalesced by the single serialized drain (one `brain_tick` per
  `(dry_run,no_ai)` kind) rather than at enqueue, which raced under concurrent
  callers and could wedge on an orphaned request file.
- **Env-configurable transcript extraction** (`EXTRACT_*`) and a `--source` label
  on the tick's event-bus announcement (`brain-drain` for on-demand) so on-demand
  ticks are distinguishable from the scheduled cron in the amygdala stream.

### Bug Fixes

- **Semantic index was noise** (`embed_arcs.py`) — `build_embed_text` never read
  `summary` and embedded the identical empty stub scaffolding present in every
  arc, so all arcs were roughly equidistant from every query (a uniform prior, not
  an index). `Summary:` now leads the embed blob, stub scaffolding is stripped, and
  `summary` is carried in embedding metadata. Requires a one-off
  `embed_arcs.py --force-all` to rebuild the index.
- **Summary truncation** mid-word, **unsummarized writer arcs** never offered for
  synthesis, and **duplicate inline markers** folded into arcs (36% of the vault) —
  all corrected.
- **`brain_tick` poll hang** — a `GET /tick/{job_id}` returning `unknown` (stale or
  consumed id) no longer polls the full timeout and falsely reports "queued"; it is
  terminal after a short grace. A `job_id`-less enqueue response is an explicit
  error rather than a silent skip of `wait`.
- **Atomic embed state write** — `embed_arcs` writes its mtime-state file via a temp
  file + `os.replace`, so the 1-min drain embed and the 2h cron embed colliding at
  HH:07 cannot corrupt it.
- **Invalid escape sequences** fixed, with a cache- and Python-version-independent
  CI guard (`check_escapes.py`) so they surface in CI instead of only warning on a
  fresh pod start.
- **Fresh arcs were hidden behind stale indexed heat** (`brain_search_arcs`) — the
  `min_heat` default of 2 filtered against the heat *snapshot taken when the arc was
  last embedded*, while heat is recomputed every tick. A just-ticked arc still reads
  0 there, as does a promoted arc sitting in `frontal-lobe/conscious`, so the default
  discarded exactly the newest content the caller was looking for. Default is now 0
  (rank by similarity); the parameter is documented as the stale-heat cut it is.
- **Un-summarized arcs were unfindable by their own content** (`embed_arcs.py`) —
  with no `summary` and no recognized sections, `build_embed_text` emitted only
  title and region, so an arc's body never reached the index. A body excerpt is now
  embedded as a `Content:` block in that case, making content-bearing arcs
  retrievable before the AI synthesis pass ever runs.
- **Compose `tick-drain` diverged from the Helm one** (`compose.yml`) — the Compose
  drain never ran `embed_arcs.py`, so on the Compose path a forced tick rewrote the
  vault while pgvector stayed stale and `brain_tick` reported success on content
  that stayed unsearchable. It also ran one tick per queued request instead of
  coalescing by kind, and omitted the `BRAIN_DECAY_*` / `BRAIN_STALE_SIGNAL_DAYS`
  tuning that `tick-cron` carries, so drain ticks and scheduled ticks could
  promote/demote the same arc differently. All three corrected.
- **A single failed `mv` aborted the whole drain** (both `compose.yml` and
  `helm/brain-ops/templates/tick-drain-cronjob.yaml`) — `run_kind`'s last statement was
  the file-move loop, so a `for` loop's exit status became the function's, and under
  `set -eu` a bare call site killed the script outright. By that point `brain_tick.py`
  had already run and mutated the vault, so a permission error, stale NFS handle, or
  ENOSPC discarded completed work, skipped every remaining bucket, and emitted no
  `drain-summary` at all — the failure was invisible. On Compose, `restart:
  unless-stopped` then respawned the container into a tight loop re-running the tick.
  Failed moves are now warned, counted in a new `stuck=` summary field, and retried on
  the next pass; `run_kind` returns 0 explicitly so the call site can never inherit a
  move's status. Reproduced against the real extracted script under `dash` before and
  after the fix.
- **Helm and Compose disagreed on signal ageing** — `helm/brain-ops/values.yaml` shipped
  `BRAIN_STALE_SIGNAL_DAYS: "1"` while Compose and the code default in
  `brain_keeper.py` both use `3`, so stock Helm aged signals out three times faster
  than stock Compose for no stated reason. Helm now matches the code default. **This
  changes behaviour for anyone running stock chart values**; pin it back in your
  overlay if you relied on 1-day ageing.
- **Four of five charts pinned a tag that does not exist** — `brain-api`, `brain-ops`,
  `embeddings`, and `mcp` all defaulted to `image.tag: latest`, which CI has never
  published, so a stock `helm install` produced `ImagePullBackOff` on every one of
  them. All now default to `:dev`, verified by rendering each chart. This is the
  functional counterpart to the `:latest` documentation error below — the docs
  described a tag that did not exist and the charts tried to pull it.

### Documentation

- **Compose update/redeploy procedure documented** (`local/README.md`, `README.md`).
  Compose builds from the source tree, so `docker compose up -d` after a `git pull`
  silently keeps running the old image — `--build` is the step that makes a change
  take effect, and that was written down nowhere. Adds branch guidance (`dev` =
  newest, `main` = stamped snapshot), a source-directory → service rebuild map, how
  to verify the new code is actually live, and what survives an update.
- **`CLAUDE.md` gained a "Redeploying after a code change" section** so an agent
  working in a fresh clone detects which path the checkout is running (Compose vs
  Kubernetes) and follows the correct one, rather than defaulting to editing a live
  container.
- **`:latest` corrected** — `local/README.md` told readers to pull
  `agentibrain-<service>:latest`, which CI has never published; only `:dev` exists,
  so that instruction produced a pull failure. `main` is also described accurately
  as the snapshot branch (it publishes no image and deploys nothing) in place of the
  stale "vestigial" wording in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, and
  `docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md`.
- **Compose topology corrected** — the local guide described 7 containers and omitted
  `tick-drain` from its diagram; the stack is 8, and the on-demand tick path is now
  documented via `POST /tick` (which also refreshes the index) rather than a
  `docker compose exec` into `tick-cron` (which does not).
- **`:latest` purged repo-wide** — the tag was referenced as a real, pullable image in
  `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, `docs/MCP.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/architecture/
  ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture/CLUSTERS.md`, `helm/README.md`, `index.md`, and
  `README.md`. CI has only ever published `:dev`, so every one of those instructions
  fails. `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` was the sharpest case: its remedy told the reader to
  "force docker-build to rebuild `:latest`", a build that structurally cannot happen.
- **MCP tool count corrected** — `README.md` advertised 5 tools and `docs/MCP.md` 4;
  `services/mcp/app/server.py` registers 6. `brain_tick` was missing from the tool table
  a reader checks `/mcp` against.
- **Image count corrected** — six Compose services declare a build but share only four
  images (`tick-cron`, `tick-drain`, and `amygdala` are one `brain-ops` image with
  different entrypoints), so "rebuilding all six images" overstated the work by 50%.
- **Healthcheck expectation corrected** — the docs told the reader to run
  `docker compose ps` and expect "all healthy", which three of eight services can never
  report: `services/brain-ops/Dockerfile` declares no `HEALTHCHECK`, so `tick-cron`,
  `tick-drain`, and `amygdala` show a bare `Up` by design. The docs now say so, rather
  than priming a first-run user to read correct behaviour as a fault.
- **Non-existent MinIO removed** — `docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md` claimed the root Compose stack
  ships an object store; it ships Postgres and Redis. (MinIO exists only in the `brain`
  CLI's rendered template, a different path.) The stale `services/tick-engine/` build
  path in `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` was also corrected to `services/brain-ops/`.
- **`docs/operations/BRAIN-INJECTION-REPAIR.md` added** — the work order and outcome for
  this release's headline repair (arc synthesis + the embedding index), previously
  shipped without a changelog entry.
- **Broken self-reference fixed** — `CHANGELOG.md` pointed at `docs/RELEASING.md`, which
  does not exist in this repo. It now names the actual mechanism: dispatch
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` with a `bump` input.

### Brain profile

- **Rewritten to say what the brain is, not how it is built** — the profile spent
  most of its budget teaching agents the brain's mechanics: service topology, vault
  schema, the five tick phases and their cadence, which hook fires on which event.
  None of it changes how an agent uses the brain, and all of it loaded on every
  session of every chained profile. `CLAUDE.md` now carries what an agent needs —
  what the brain is, that context arrives already injected, what an arc and heat
  are, the six tools with when to reach for each, the regions, marker syntax and
  severities, channels, and the few real constraints.
- **`rules/04-vault-layout.md` and `rules/05-tick-cadence.md` removed** — tick
  internals and a vault schema agents cannot write to and never reason about. The
  three remaining rules keep only what `CLAUDE.md` does not: when to search and when
  not to, the editorial bar per marker type, and broadcast etiquette.
- **`brain_tick` added to the profile's tool inventory** — it shipped in this release
  but appeared nowhere in the profile, so an agent reading it had no idea it could
  force its own writes to become searchable. A feature that exists and is
  undiscoverable is not shipped.
- Net effect: **31.5 KB → 6.7 KB**, a 79% cut, roughly 6,200 tokens returned to every
  session that chains this profile.

### CI

- **`deploy-assets` workflow added** — nothing in CI has ever looked at the Helm charts
  or the Compose stack on any branch: `docker-build` is path-filtered to `services/**`
  and `ci` only runs on `main`. That blind spot is why four charts could pin an
  unpublishable tag indefinitely. The new job renders every chart, asserts that no
  first-party image reference resolves to anything but `:dev` (checked both in values
  and in the rendered manifests, since a values-level grep misses a tag baked into a
  template), validates `docker compose config`, and syntax-checks the `tick-drain` and
  `tick-cron` entrypoints under **dash** rather than bash — the container runs
  `/bin/sh`, and bash hides POSIX violations. The tag assertion was verified to fail on
  an injected `tag: latest` before being committed, so it is a real gate rather than a
  green rubber stamp.

### Security

- **Deployment-specific detail removed from the public repo** — a private LAN NFS
  server address and namespace were hardcoded in
  `helm/brain-ops/jobs/vault-cleanup.yaml`; these are now `<your-*>` placeholders
  with a PVC alternative shown. Operator-specific platform names were also removed
  from `docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md`, `helm/brain-ops/values.yaml`, an operations write-up
  that quoted real vault arc content, and sample cluster IDs in source comments and
  tests. No credential values were present at any point.
- **Real private session data removed from the architecture docs** — the "Cluster
  Primitive — Schema" example in `docs/architecture/CLUSTERS.md` was not synthetic: it
  carried two real session UUIDs with their turn counts, nine real PR numbers from a
  private repo, a real secret-store variable rename, and a private service scheme.
  `docs/architecture/KEEPER.md` carried a real internal gateway `model_id` UUID, a real
  cross-repo PR reference, and real dated run identifiers; `docs/architecture/
  MATURITY.md` carried the same run identifiers plus an internal planning codename.
  All replaced with synthetic values that preserve the schema shape and the reusable
  lessons.
- **The de-branding changelog entry was itself the leak** — the historical 0.6.x entries
  named the exact strings the scrub had removed, republishing the operator's account
  name, private domain, and deployment names in a public repo. Those entries now
  describe the change without naming what was scrubbed.
- **`docs/operations/BRAIN-INJECTION-REPAIR.md` generalized** — a real incident
  postmortem quoting live transcript content. The credential-echo lesson that motivated
  `redact.py` is kept; the estate-identifying specifics are gone. No credential value
  was ever committed — only a path to a file on private storage.
- **Dead `operator/` links removed from `README.md`** — the directory is gitignored, so
  five links 404'd for every reader while confirming the structure of a private planning
  directory. Points at the published `docs/architecture/MATURITY.md` instead.

- **Credential redaction at every persist and inject boundary** (`redact.py`) — the
  tick echoed its own prompt input, amplifying a leaked token across dozens of vault
  files. Every persist point (AI-output audit, intent, summaries) and inject
  boundary now scrubs credentials (superset secret regex plus `NAME=value`
  assignments).

### Known follow-ups (not in this release)

- Concurrent `brain_tick` (scheduled cron + a non-empty drain at HH:07) can still
  race on vault file writes — pre-existing; the safe fix is atomic writes in
  `brain_keeper`'s output layer, not an NFS lock (unreliable across pods, and a
  blocking lock risks a stale-lock hang that would fail the drain).
- The `brain_tick` MCP tool is callable only after the MCP gateway re-lists tools
  (operator-managed propagation).
- ClickHouse `tick_health.tick_type` still records `'full'` for on-demand ticks; the
  event-bus `source` field distinguishes them, but the ClickHouse column would need
  a schema migration.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-17

**Brain self-healing**: closes a class of self-reinforcing degradations that pinned the dev brain at health score 2/10 with a stacking nuclear-signal loop. After this release, the brain produces real graph mutations every tick (was 0 for 30+ hours), the amygdala stops emitting from its own output, and the AI tick prompt sees the full 144-arc vault instead of 1.

### Features

- **`brain_apply.collapse_multi_type_same_pair`** — edges now collapse by `(source, target)` using a priority order (`parent > child > sibling > unblocks > supersedes > related`). Prior dedup keyed on `(source, type, target)`, so different type strings escaped and accumulated. 295 such collisions cleared from the live vault on first run.
- **Cross-tick `any_to_target` edge guard** in `apply_edges` — once a source has any edge to a target, subsequent emissions of a different type to the same target are silently rejected. Prevents multi-type accumulation across ticks forever.
- **`services/brain-ops/scripts/dedupe_edges.py`** — idempotent one-shot vault cleanup. Removes duplicate edges, self-loops, multi-type collisions; report distinguishes `dedup_dropped` from `type_collapsed`.
- **`services/brain-ops/scripts/tombstone_signals.py`** — companion to dedupe; marks active `@signal` blocks `severity=resolved` + `(CLEARED: ...)` prefix so the next tick drops them.
- **Lesson dedup in the AI tick prompt** keyed on first-line (what the AI actually sees), not full content. Empty-body lessons skipped.
- **Region-walk** ported into `brain_tick_prompt.build_prompt` AND `brain_apply.find_arc_file` / `apply_signal_changes`. The prompt previously scanned `clusters/<date>/*.md` only (1 arc survived filter, of 144 in vault); the apply side silently dropped every edge/signal whose source was a region-resident promoted arc.
- **Amygdala self-emission loop closed** (`brain_tick.py` + `amygdala.py`):
  - `brain_tick.py` publishes `brain.tick.complete` (was `tick.complete`) with an explicit `severity` field — nuclear only when the tick mechanism itself failed (parse-fail sentinel or `ai.error=true`); warning for score ≤ 3; info for score ≥ 4 (filtered out by amygdala).
  - `amygdala.py` defense-in-depth: skips `write_incident_arc` when `source=="brain-cron"` regardless of severity. The brain's own tick output is a status broadcast, not an incident.

### Bug Fixes

- `brain_apply.parse_edges` strips backticks from captured node IDs and drops self-loops at parse time.
- Dir-bucketed `merged_stems` in `brain_keeper._scan_and_collect`, `brain_tick_prompt._scan`, `brain_apply.find_arc_file` — under recursive scan, a `foo.merged.md` in one subdir no longer suppresses an unrelated `foo.md` in a sibling subdir. Latent shared bug, fleet-wide fix.
- `brain_tick_prompt._scan` now logs `WARN: failed to parse {file}: {e}` on parse error (parity with `brain_keeper`).
- `brain_tick_prompt.build_prompt` signal sample deduped by `(source, content_hash)` so a signal promoted to `frontal-lobe/conscious/` doesn't appear twice.
- `brain-api/vault_reader.search_vault` caps the line-hit score component at 30 — a 500-line journal file no longer crushes semantic search results.
- `Dockerfile` for `brain-ops` now copies `scripts/` so the maintenance tools ship in the image.

### Local-compose readiness

- `local/bootstrap.sh` scaffolds the full vault region tree via `cp -rn agentibrain/templates/vault-layout/`.
- `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` (singular, consumer-side) aligned to the same generated value as `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEYS` (plural, embeddings inbound whitelist).
- `.mcp.json.example` + README unified on `x-api-key` header (was contradictory).
- README tool count corrected to 5 (was 4 — `brain_ingest` was missing from the table), container count 7 (was 8 in `local/README.md`), port override variable renamed `PORT_KB_ROUTER` → `PORT_BRAIN_API`.

### Operations measured against dev cluster

| Metric | Pre-release | Post-release |
|---|---|---|
| `edges_applied` per tick | 0 (30+ hours) | 10–20 |
| Stacked nuclear `brain-cron` signals | 14 (growing +1/tick) | 0 (loop broken) |
| Health score floor | 2/10 | 6/10 |
| Vault arc count visible to AI | 1 | 146 |
| Multi-type edge collisions in vault | 295 | 0 |

### Known follow-ups (not in this release)

- `apply_merges` doesn't re-dedupe edges over the concatenated merged-arc body — AI flagged "triplicated edges" on `2026-04-28-7242ddf3-writer` after a merge.
- Empty Grafana panels for Broadcast Cortex / Hippocampus / Hook Observability — telemetry gap lives in `agentihooks-bundle`, not this kernel.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-12

**Architecture simplification**: `obsidian-reader` absorbed into `brain-api` as in-process `vault_reader.py`. Services renamed for consistency (`kb-router` → `brain-api`, `brain-cron` → `brain-ops`, `tick-engine` → `brain-ops`, `mcp-agentibrain` → `agentibrain-mcp`). MCP surface completed with native `brain_ingest`. Eliminates one pod, one image, one network hop.

### Breaking Changes

- **`obsidian-reader` service retired.** Image `ghcr.io/the-cloud-clockwork/agentibrain-obsidian-reader:*` is no longer published. Downstream consumers must remove references to it.
- **`kb-router` renamed to `brain-api`** — image `ghcr.io/the-cloud-clockwork/agentibrain-brain-api:dev`. The `agentibrain-kb-router` image is no longer published.
- **`brain-cron` and `tick-engine` consolidated into `brain-ops`** — image `ghcr.io/the-cloud-clockwork/agentibrain-brain-ops:dev`.
- **HTTP `/ingest` no longer requires the `artifact-store` external dependency** — body writes go straight to the vault filesystem via `vault_reader.write`.

### Features

- **5 MCP tools live**: `kb_search`, `kb_brief`, `brain_search_arcs`, `brain_get_arc`, `brain_ingest`. New `brain_ingest` writes text directly to the vault through `brain-api /ingest` (no artifact-store wrapper).
- **`brain_keeper` runs Phase 0 inbox drain on every tick** — `raw/inbox/*.md` is moved into region directories before scanning. Inbox drain also sets `region` + `status` frontmatter so arcs land where they belong.
- **`embed_arcs` + `brain_keeper` scan all region dirs** (`bridge/`, `left/`, `right/`, `frontal-lobe/`, `pineal/`, `amygdala/`) plus `clusters/`. Previously scanned only `clusters/` and missed 97% of arcs (4 → 144 arcs surfaced).
- **`brain_get_arc` uses direct `/by-key/{key}` DB lookup** on the embeddings service with vault fallback.
- **`brain-keeper` rebuilt as a self-contained agent package** — own `CLAUDE.md`, `command.yml`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`. The stale `agentihooks` profile is deleted (`AGENTIHOOKS_PROFILE=""`).
- **Brain profile rewritten with full tool inventory + auto-lookup rules + markers-vs-ingest decision table.**

### Bug Fixes

- `brain_keeper` `inject_blocks` deduped by SHA-256 content hash in `write_inject_feed`.
- `brain_keeper` skips promote/demote/graduate when source == destination.
- `brain_keeper.REGION_DIRS` lifted to module level for reuse.
- `brain-tick` AI prompt instructs the model to not emit duplicate signals for issues already in the active list.
- `mcp` SDK pinned `<1.26` — stdio framing incompatible with `mcp-proxy 6.4`.
- 5 bugs from a fresh code review pass: compose template, async boundary, path traversal, fallback URL, TOCTOU on file writes.
- Dead `OBSIDIAN_READER_TOKEN` removed from `k8s-bootstrap.sh`.

### Local-compose Quick Start (laptop path)

- `compose.yml` 7-container stack matching K8s topology, embeddings healthcheck uses Python urllib (no `curl` in image).
- `tick --no-ai` auto-detect when `INFERENCE_URL` is empty.
- `local/compose.ollama.yml` overlay for the free local LLM path.
- README Quick Start: 5 steps from `git clone` to a working brain with Claude Code MCP wiring.
- `activeDeadlineSeconds` bumped 600 → 1200 on brain-ops CronJob.

### Migration

Downstream Helm charts (your platform repo) must:
1. Remove `obsidian-reader` Application + chart references.
2. Switch image pins from `agentibrain-kb-router` → `agentibrain-brain-api`.
3. Switch image pins from `agentibrain-brain-cron` / `agentibrain-tick-engine` → `agentibrain-brain-ops`.
4. Remove `OBSIDIAN_READER_URL` / `OBSIDIAN_READER_TOKEN` env from any callers (in-process now).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-04

**Documentation, observability, and naming consistency**: complete scrub of operator-specific names across user-facing docs + source, GitHub org rename (`the-cloud-clock-work` → `the-cloud-clockwork`), ecosystem prefix change (`tccw-` → `tcc-`), and self-contained Grafana enablement.

### Breaking Changes

- **GitHub org rename**: `the-cloud-clock-work` → `the-cloud-clockwork`. All image refs, Helm OCI references, and clone URLs must update.
- **Ecosystem prefix change**: `tccw-` → `tcc-` across chart names, image names, package names.

### Features

- **MCP chart** (`helm/mcp`) — 6th brain chart shipping the agentibrain-mcp service.
- **Self-contained Grafana enablement** — `setup-grafana` bootstrap script provisions datasources + dashboards from files, no manual UI setup.
- **brain-health Grafana dashboard JSON** shipped under `observability/`.
- **GitHub Pages site** via Jekyll + just-the-docs theme (4-section sidebar + Home).
- **`docker-build` workflow** now has `workflow_dispatch` for manual rebuilds.
- **Amygdala** points at Redis DB 11 and ticks announce themselves to the event bus.

### Bug Fixes

- `brain.tick_health` ClickHouse schema bootstraps idempotently on first tick.
- `brain-health` panel handles missing `signals` frontmatter (treats `'0'` and `false` as equivalent).
- `setup-grafana` respects existing file-provisioned datasources instead of attempting API-only injection.
- Jekyll Pages build excludes `agentibrain/` and `observability/` to avoid Liquid template collisions with template-syntax files.

### Docs scrub

- All operator-specific deployment, host, and account names removed from user-facing docs + Python sources + tests + CLAUDE.md.
- Vault layout templates reframed from "operator" voice to "user/your" voice.
- README rewrite: six charts story, image publish flow, Claude Code wiring three-step.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-29

**Helm portability, ArgoCD parity, generic LLM gateway**: kernel decouples from operator-specific deployment shape. Charts ship portable defaults. Inference routes move from operator overlays to kernel with a generic gateway contract.

### Features

- **Generic LLM gateway contract** (`docs/brain/GATEWAY-CONTRACT.md`, `brain-models.yaml`). Inference routes live in the kernel and consume any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `INFERENCE_URL` / `INFERENCE_API_KEY`.
- **Portable Helm chart defaults** + `k8s-bootstrap.sh` — clean install on a fresh cluster without operator-specific overlay paths.
- **ArgoCD brain Applications** imported into kernel `k8s/` with operator-overlay reference for downstream consumers.
- **NFS vault mount** wired through operator overlays + obsidian-reader dev profile.
- Inference routes migrated from operator overlays to kernel.
- `tccw-k8s-service-template` bumped to `0.3.6` (v1beta1 ESO).

### Bug Fixes

- ESO re-enabled in operator overlays (Pass A regression).
- `brain-keeper` pins agentihooks/bundle/hub to `dev` branch by default.
- `brain-keeper` wires `POD_NAME` + `AGENTIHOOKS_HOME` for per-pod state isolation.
- `brain-keeper` storageClass pinned to `local-path` in operator overlays.
- ArgoCD same-repo-revision parity + mcp-proxy chart source.

### Docs

- `HELM-QUICKSTART.md` + brain inference routes reference doc.
- README documents brain inference env vars + links to gateway contract.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-28

**Heat engine + `.merged.md` parity + local docker-compose deploy**: closes promote pipeline gaps and ships the non-K8s deployment path.

### Features

- **Local docker-compose deployment** (PR #9) for non-K8s users. Stack mirrors the K8s topology on a laptop.
- **Self-cleaning embeddings** (PR #14) — `POST /prune` endpoint + cron-wired reaper that drops embeddings for arcs deleted from the vault.

### Bug Fixes

- **Heat engine unstuck** (PR #10) — env-driven thresholds + softer decay curve. Arcs were getting stuck at low heat indefinitely.
- **`.merged.md` arcs included in tick processing** (PR #11) — was dropping 4 hot arcs from the promote pipeline.
- **Heat formula tolerates missing `signals` frontmatter** (PR #12) — uses 0 default instead of raising.
- **`embed_arcs` processes `.merged.md`** (PR #13) — parity with `brain_keeper`, was dropping ~40 arcs from semantic search.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-27

**Phase 8 Block 1+2 — kernel owns all 5 brain charts.**

Migration of the `kb-router`, `obsidian-reader`, and `embeddings` charts from the downstream platform repo into this kernel. `brain-keeper` and `brain-cron` bumped to `0.1.1` with amygdala template using `{{ .Chart.Name }}-amygdala`. All 5 render cleanly via `helm template`. 4 of 5 wrap `tccw-k8s-service-template v0.3.4` from `oci://ghcr.io/the-cloud-clock-work`. `brain-cron` keeps custom templates.

See [release notes for v0.1.1](https://github.com/the-cloud-clockwork/agentibrain-kernel/releases/tag/v0.1.1) for full chart inventory + ArgoCD multi-source consumption pattern.
